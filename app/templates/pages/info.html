    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The Wait Wait Don't Tell Me! Stats Page provides details about Not My
        Job guests, shows, hosts, scorekeepers, panelist and locations with the
        data presented in a straightfoward, if not slightly minimal, format.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page provides additional information and context to how the data
        is presented and notated for each section of this site.
    </p>

    <h3 id="shows">Shows</h3>
    <p>
        The following is a live example of the information block with data and
        details for the show that aired on
        <a href="{{ url_for('shows.year_month_day', show_year=show_date.year, show_month=show_date.month, show_day=show_date.day) }}">{{ show_date.isoformat() }}</a>,
        though with the show description and notes fields removed for brevity.
    </p>

    <div class="mx-2">
    {% include "shows/details.html" %}
    </div>

    <h4>Badges</h4>
    <p>
        The first section of the show information block displays the various
        badges for the show. All shows will have a badge with a link to the
        show page on NPR's website and a database ID for the show in the Wait
        Wait Stats Database. This database ID does not represent the show number
        or the proper order of all shows. Instead, the database ID is useful for
        querying the Wait Wait Stats data via the
        <a href="{{ api_url }}" target="_blank">Wait Wait Stats API
        <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right px-1" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional badges will appear to denote Best Of and repeat shows. The
        repeat show badge will also include the original show date and a link
        to the show page.
    </p>

    <h4>People and Places</h4>
    <p>
        The next sections include the location where the show was recorded,
        including the name of the venue, city and state, the host and the
        scorekeeper for the show. If the show has a guest host or a guest
        scorekeeper, their name will be prefixed with "Guest".
    </p>
    <p>
        If the scorekeeper introduced themself in a unique way, their
        intro quote will be listed above the scorekeeper name.
    </p>

    <h5>Panelists</h5>
    <p>
        The Panelists section includes a list of panelists who were on the
        panel for a regular show. For Best Of shows, all panelists who made
        appearances on the original show where each segment came from.
    </p>
    <p>
        If panelist scoring information is available, panelist ranking and
        scoring information will be included. The Wait Wait Stats Project uses
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking">standard competition
        ranking</a> where a gap is in place between the tied panelists and the
        next rank after that.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, a show in which two panelists sharing the highest score are
        ranked as "First Tied" while the remaining panelist would be ranked as
        "Third". This ranking method was chosen due to the inconsistent ranking
        method used on each Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! show.
    </p>
    <p>
        The scoring information for each panelist includes their total score,
        and if available, the score they had at the start of the final round
        (currently known as "Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank") and how many
        questions they answered correctly. The total score should equal the
        sum of starting score plus two times the number of correct answers.
        There can also be scoring anamolies that lead to a panelist not getting
        credit for correct answers. Any scoring anamolies should be noted in the
        Notes section for the show.
    </p>

    <h5>Not My Job Guest(s)</h5>
    <p>
        The Guest(s) section will include a list of one or more Not My Job
        guests and their score, based on the number of questions that were
        correctly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a scoring exception was given, be it the scorekeeper given the
        guest(s) a win even if they did not correctly answer two or more
        questions or granting all three points, an asterisk (*) will denote the
        exception and an explanation included in the Notes section.
    </p>

    <h5>Bluff</h5>
    <p>
        The Bluff section will include a list data for each of the Bluff the
        Listener or Bluff-like segment with the panelist whose story or topic
        was chosen and the panelist whose story or topic was correct. Shows from
        1998 had segments called "We'll Wait, You Tell Us" and "Listener Bluff"
        in which the listener contestant must correctly choose the correct story
        or topic to win. The first time "Bluff the Listener" was used for a
        segment name was on the
        <a href="{{ url_for('shows.year_month_day', show_year=1998, show_month=11, show_day=28) }}">1998-11-28</a>
        show.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only shows with a unique Bluff segment will have data entered, which
        would regular shows with a Bluff segment or Best Of shows that include
        Bluff segments that have never been included in a previous regular or
        Best Of show. Such unique Bluff segments from Best Of shows would be
        segments that were done when Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! travels to
        other cities and have a second show taping.

        database ID for the guest in the Wait Wait Stats Database. As with the
        database ID for each show, the ID does not represent any official
        numbering or ID used by Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!
    </p>
    
    <h4>Appearances</h4>
    <p>
        The first two pieces of data presented in the appearances section are
        the number of times the guest has appeared on regular shows (excluding
        Best Of and repeat shows) and on all shows (including regular, Best Of
        and repeat shows).
    </p>

    <h4>List of Appearances</h4>
    <p>
        Following the appearances section is a list of shows that the guest have
        appeared on and their score from the Not My Job segment, if available.

        scoring exceptions will be marked with an asterisk (*).

        sections.
    </p>

        the database ID for the respective host or scorekeeper in the Wait Wait
        Stats Database. As with the database ID for each show, the ID does not
        represent any official numbering or ID used by Wait Wait... Don't Tell
        Me!
    </p>
    <p>
        If preferred pronouns have been collected and entered into the Wait Wait
        Stats Database, a pronouns badge will be displayed. The pronouns will
        only be entered into the database if the host or scorekeeper provides
        them in their own official social media bio or on their official
        website. If their preferred pronouns cannot be found from either source,
        then none are entered into the database.

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>
        One of the inspirations that I had when building this site was
        <a href="http://www.mrkland.com/mrkland.com/passive/WWDTM/index.htm">mrk.'s
        Wait Wait Don't Tell Me Statistics Pages</a> 
        (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190404122827/http://www.mrkland.com/zone/WWDTM/index.htm">Internet
        Archive</a>). I used some of the scoring data from that site
        to fill in some of the informational blanks for some of the shows prior
        to Peter Sagal becoming the show's host.

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>
    One of the inspirations that I had when building this site was
    <a href="http://www.mrkland.com/mrkland.com/passive/WWDTM/index.htm">mrk.'s
    Wait Wait Don't Tell Me Statistics Pages</a> 
    (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190404122827/http://www.mrkland.com/zone/WWDTM/index.htm">Internet
    Archive</a>). I used some of the scoring data from that site
    to fill in some of the informational blanks for some of the shows prior
    to Peter Sagal becoming the show's host.
</p>

<p>
    I would like to thank David Moss for providing a list of the direct
    links for each show page on NPR.org for the shows from 2006 through 2023.
</p>

<p>
    I would also like to thank Elijah Conners for contributing code to
    display a map of a location, using OpenStreetMaps, in the location
    details page.
